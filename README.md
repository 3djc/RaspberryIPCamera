# RaspberryIPCamera
Raspberry IP Camera configurable through PHP web interface

Features:
* PHP/Bootstrap Web Interface with secured login page
* Two streaming standards, MJPEG and H.264
* Integrated RTSP server

Hi, welcome to my Raspberry IP Camera build.
This project was brought to life out of personal interest and the lack of readily available sources of easy configurable camera software for the Raspberry Pi

The IP camera is built on top of a foundation Raspbian Jessie Minimal image and consists of three major parts:
* The PHP/Bootstrap web interface
* The UV4L software from http://www.linux-projects.org
* The RTSP server from https://github.com/mpromonet/h264_v4l2_rtspserver

Everyone can build the camera themselves according to the instruction manual in this github repository (see installation.sh) or just download the image at http://cheetah.dscloud.me:8080/RaspberryPI-IP-Camera-v1.1-beta.zip
